# NOTE: This file is AUTO-GENERATED once by './.pgs/' by taking the template
#       from https://github.com/pinf/genesis.pinf.org/blob/master/.pgs/vortex/.cleanignore.tpl
#       and inserting any content from a pre-existing file into '% %__EXISTING__% %'.
#       This file may be comitted to git and maintained manually from now on. If not comitted
#       to git, the pre-existing file content will be recovered on 'clean' by doing
#       a 'git reset'.
#       If you don't want './.pgs/' to leave any trace behind in your original code,
#       DO NOT COMMIT THIS CODE (remove line if you decide to do so)
